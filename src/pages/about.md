What makes this book unique is the simplicity of the recipes and time-saving tips and tricks I learned while experimenting with different tastes and flavours. As a fruit lover and health enthusiast, it was my deepest wish to share the knowledge acquired in these past years living in Canada. Since I was never a winter sports person, I spent the long 6-months winters experimenting in my kitchen lab, which quickly became my favourite area of my small 3 1/2 apartment. Being dairy intolerant also pushed me out of my comfort zone and made me discover the vast range of vegan flavours; this is why I opted for the vegan smoothies e-book. Not because of the increased popularity of vegan, but specifically to reach a wider audience. Also, feel free to adapt my recipes as it best fits your flavours and culture!

â€¦. In the end, I JUST wanted to FOLLOW MY PASSION and share it with the ENTIRE world so that I can help you get a bit healthier and environmentally friendlier.
