Hi, I am Barbara. A recipe developer, e-book author and yoga teacher  (IG: @agileyogi) in training who enjoys helping people live a healthy and balanced lifestyle. With this blog, I would like to inspire you to make healthy choices every day so that you can, in turn, inspire others through your example.

My recipes are all 100% vegan and very affordable. I like to use whole foods, less or non-processed ingredients. Having healthy food on the table is quite affordable and eating quality fresh ingredients will keep you fuller and more energetic. 

My smoothies VEGAN e-book contains from 3-5 ingredients per smoothie and has tips and tricks for each reciper. I am all for agile cooking, swapping ingredients and adding your variations to fit your taste and dietary needs.
